	This project is basic on the open source project TinyThread++,And I had transfered it to Android.

	You can compile it using NDK in android2.2 above, I had tested it successfully.


	In Java part, there is some class you can use in the package com.ki4wangdy.tinyThread :
	(Mutex):
	1.FastLock
	2.Lock
	3.RecursiveLock
	You can reference the difference between these class in the tinyThread++ project.

	(Condition):
	1.Condition
	This class "Condition" means the same as the java native Condition, you can reference the usage of java class.
	

	(Thread):
	1.Thread
	
	The Thread class had provided some basic function you can use, I think it is enough in pratice.


==========================The following is Android part ========================================

	First, you can import this project into Eclipse.
	In the class "MainActivity", there are some static codes,which are used to launch the UnitTest.
